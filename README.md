# Ball-Balancing-Robot
An educational Ball-Balancing Robot. This project introduces some of the core concepts of robotics: programming, inverse kinematics, computer vision, and PID control.

This branch uses a 4-arm design with servo channels mapped to `0`, `4`, `8`, and `12` on the PCA9685 controller.

### Motor Angle Calibration
Each of the four motors must be calibrated. Follow these exact steps:

1. **Set all motor offsets to `0`.**  
   In `controller.py`, inside the `set_motor_angles` function under class `RobotController`, make sure it looks like this:  
   ```python
   self.s1.angle = clamp(theta1)
   self.s2.angle = clamp(theta2)
   self.s3.angle = clamp(theta3)
   self.s4.angle = clamp(theta4)
   ```
2. **Initialize the robot.**  
   Power on the robot. Then, in your terminal (in correct directory), run:  
   `python controller.py`  
   This sets the initial motor positions. Once the robot has reached its position, **do not touch it**. Power it off, then use a level or measurement tool to check how flat the top plate is.

3. **Tune each motor's angle offset.**  
   Based on how the plate is tilted, adjust each motor's angle by adding or subtracting an offset. Modify the code like this:
   ```python
   self.s1.angle = clamp(theta1) + OFFSET_S1
   self.s2.angle = clamp(theta2) + OFFSET_S2
   self.s3.angle = clamp(theta3) + OFFSET_S3
   self.s4.angle = clamp(theta4) + OFFSET_S4
   ```
   Replace each `OFFSET_Sn` with the value needed to make the plate level. These values are specific to your hardware and may differ for each motor.

4. **Iterate until balanced.**  
   Repeat steps 2 and 3. Re-run the controller, check the plate, and adjust the offsets as needed. Continue this process until the top plate is completely flat and stable.

### Verification Tests
- Run servo mapping checks with: `python -m unittest tests.test_servo_channels`
- Run camera checks with: `python -m unittest tests.test_camera`
- Or run a quick hardware smoke test with: `python verify_system.py`
